# hackatruck_makerspace
The training offered by HackaTruck MakerSpace begins with the online course (EAD) "Concepts and Fundamentals: Algorithms and Object-Oriented Programming with Swift." Application of the active teaching methodology CBL (Challenge Based Learning).
   Development environment Xcode, where we will build our first iOS applications, as well as understand how a Swift-developed application works.
    Use of the IBM Cloud platform (cloudant) from Swift applications using REST API requests with the use of the web application Node-RED and cognitive services available on the IBM Cloud platform, studying concepts of text to speech, speech to text, Translate, and Natural Language Understanding (NLU), which can be reflected in standalone applications such as bots and mobile applications, along with the Watson Assistant technology that will be applied to develop virtual assistants using conversation chatbots. Integration practices of cognitive services combined with mobile applications will be addressed in classes integrating these technologies.
   Deepening of IoT (Internet of Things) concepts, again linked to the IBM Cloud platform, communicating with our devices and the MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) communication protocol. All of this is added to the practices developed using sensors and microcontrollers, in the exploration of our maker space composed of 3D printers, tools, and components.
    All acquired knowledge will be applied to the development of an application prototype.
